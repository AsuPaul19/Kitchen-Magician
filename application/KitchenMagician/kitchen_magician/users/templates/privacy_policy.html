                    This Privacy Policy is applicable to any website, mobile app and other online service originating in the United States and owned and operated by Kitchen Magician, Inc. or any of its U.S. subsidiaries and/or affiliates under its control (collectively the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) that states it is governed by this Privacy Policy and/or links to this Privacy Policy as well as to consumer information that we receive from you or a third party in connection with Company publications and other products and services we offer to you (including both offline and online orders of subscriptions to Company magazines and other products and services we offer to consumers) unless otherwise specified (collectively, the “Service”).

                    Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
                </h3>
                <p class="term-policy-p">
                    Some functions and services offered through the Service require that you provide certain personally identifiable information (“PII”). We may also collect PII when, whether you do so offline or online, you order a subscription to a Company publication, order other products and services we offer to you, or furnish us with information relating to your order or account. PII that we may collect includes email address, name, postal address, telephone number, date of birth, credit card number or other account number. We may also collect other information about you that we associate with your PII such as your interests, preferences and demographics. For example, we may collect information about your interests in certain health, food and lifestyle topics. We collect this information for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog, or register for a mailing list. To the extent we combine information about your Service usage with PII, we will treat it as PII. However, to the extent we “de-identify” (i.e., removal or modification of personally identifiable elements or the extraction of non-personally identifiable elements, including through anonymization, pseudonymization and hashing) the information we do not consider it PII for purposes of this Privacy Policy and may, subject to applicable law, use and share it without limitation. We do not make any assurance that de-identified data is not capable of re-identification.
                    From time to time, we may make available certain applications for use on mobile or connected devices (each application, an “App”). The type of PII we collect will vary by App, but may include both precise and non-precise geolocation information for purposes such as to provide you with access to local service, offers and promotions relevant to the App (e.g., coupons for local stores). Each App may include its own privacy policy explaining how we collect PII (including geolocation information) when you use that App; if not, then this Privacy Policy will apply to the App. You should always read the applicable privacy policy before downloading the App.
